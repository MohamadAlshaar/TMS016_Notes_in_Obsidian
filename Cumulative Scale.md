To capture a domains behaviour, especially $n\geq 2$

- **K-functions**: for second order interactions
- **L-functions**: for second order interaction 
- **Empty space functions:** for higher order interactions
- **Nearest neighbour distance distributions**: for higher order interactions
- **J-functions**: for higher order interactions

**There are formulas, look at them later...**
