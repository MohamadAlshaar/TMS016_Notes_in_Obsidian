Think of temperature on a surface, each points temperature change over time can be described using a distribution, now if we add the distributions of all these points we get a joint distribution. 

If the field is **Gaussian**, then for any ($s_1$, $\ldots$, $s_n$ ), the joint distribution is:

$$
(X(s_1), \ldots, X(s_n)) \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, \Sigma)
$$



This is the **joint distribution** of pixel/intensity/measurement values at multiple locations.
