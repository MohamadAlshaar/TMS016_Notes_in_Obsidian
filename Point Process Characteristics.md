We can see how point processes behave and how well the [[Types of Processes]] worked to capture spatial data both on a **Local** scale but also a **Cumulative** scale. 

**[[Local Scale]]**: focuses on the points them selves and asks *What is happening right here or at this distance?*.
$i.e$ what is happening between the points pair-wise or more formally called *Second order interactions (2 variables)*.


**[[Cumulative Scale]]**: collects and models information of how the whole domain behaves together or over a growing distance and asks the question *How much clustering or dispersion exists up to this distance?*.
$i.e$ what is happening between the points in pair of twos or more, or more formally called *Higher order interactions (2 or more variables)*.


**Note**: Local scale characteristics can still work on simple models $n\leq 2$ to even capture a wider behaviour too.
